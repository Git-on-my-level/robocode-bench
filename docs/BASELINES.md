# Baseline Bots (stub)

Baseline bots are launched exactly like model bots and must live under `baselines/` with their own `bot-config.json`.
Populate this folder with:
- Simple reference bots (rammer, random mover, turret gunner)
- Official sample bots pinned to Tank Royale v0.34.1

Define each baseline in a manifest (TBD) so the orchestrator can include them in 1v1 + melee brackets.
